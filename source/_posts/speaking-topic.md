# Hometown
 - Where are you from?
I am from a small city which location in southeast of China and opposite to TaiWan.You may not see the hustle and bustle of big cities here.Instead,people have a quieter,slower-paced life. 
 - How long have you been living there?
I have been living in my bornplace for over 18 years.This is a place full with my memories and childhood.I really appreciate of this city.
 - Is your hometown a big city or a small city?
My hometown is a small city.It doesn't have the economy and population of a big city,but people here are friendly and happy.
 - Do you like your hometown?
There is no doubt that i like my born place.I have friends and parents here.Besides,i like its climate and culture.People live here don't need to speed up(accelerate) their pace of life.Work life balance is the best choice for me.
 - Are there anything you dislike about your hometown?
On the one hand,it's difficult for you to be employed(get a job) here,you need to learn
skills that are suitable for the needs of others.On the other hand,the cost of life is not low here.Perhaps you will worry about the expenses of food and accomodation.
 - Has your hometown changed over the years?What are the changes?
Actually,i don't find many changes here.A lot taller and modern buildings are erected.And the transportation is more convenient than past.The high speed railway develops rapidly.That's all i think about.
 - Do you think you will continue living there for a long time?
It's my pleasure to live here.But if i have the opportunity to live in another city,i think i will move to there for working and strive to my career.I don't want to limit myself in just one city.I want to exprience different lifestyles in this world.

# Work or Study

You know,when we are coding,we usually need to adjust elements of webpages and decide what color,size,font to use.It just like sulpturing,every steps you have done make your masterpiece more perfect.It make sense to me.That's my favorite part.
 - What is the most important quality of a co-worker/colleague?
I think the spirit of cooperation is the most significant.If you and your workmates don't aim to the same goal and stick together,it is hard for a team to give out the result that is valuable and satisfactory.That's lethal for a group.
 - Which matters to you more,the job itself or the people you work with?
Acutally it is hard for me to set the level with that.They are all important to me,the awlful work or terrible colleagues both make me feel bad.And i believe that will influence my work status for a whole day.
 - Have you ever changed your work before?
No,i have never chanaged my job.For me,i think i still have a long way to go and i need to improve my work skills.In my mind,it's not the good choice to change the job frequently.If you don't spend enough time and keep on what you do,you are hardly successful with anything.
 - Do you think you will change your job in the future?
I think i might change my job later.You know,people's mind changing all the time that my thoughts too.Perhaps when i arrived my thirties,i will have different decisions and change my lifestyle.And i believe i won't be work like now at that time.
 - What was your first day at work like?
I will never forget the first day i went to work.Obviously,i felt nervous and shy.And we usually don't need to do the real work in the beginning.Cuz you need to trained and ready for your job.And i spend some time on getting familiar with the people and facilites around me.And my colleagues helped me a lot,i was grateful to them.
 - What do you want your company to improve?
In my opinion,the time arrangement perhaps need to be more flexible.People nowadays have lots of personal things to do.If we  have enough for solving the problem of life and get nice work status,It will be a good news for everyone.In addition,some limitations and rules should be also set for it,the boundary must be reasonable.
 - What kind of jobs are popular in China?
As i know,people like doctor,teacher and agent would be more popular.Cuz we always think they look decent.Most of us want to have a stable job like that,if you have it,you will even praised a lot from your family and neighors.
 - Would you like to go to another country to work?
Sure thing.If i have a chance,i will.The world is so big for me,and i don't want to be limited in just one country.There are lots of things that i want to explore and experience.Life is just once,don't waste your time and opportunities.

In my view,the house don't need to be too big,enough is just ok.The most important factor is who you live with.I want to have a house with second floor and my family is all here.When i finish my daily work,i back home and get into it,then i feel relax and pleased.Cuz i know,that's my home.

I am from FuJian Province,QuanZhou City.It is oppsite to TaiWan.In the southeast of China.

 - What are some changes in the area recently?

 - What's the most popular meas of transpotation in your hometown?
Actually the transpotation of my hometown is not that convenient.There is no subway.We often go out by electric bike or bus.We don't really like driving,it's easy to get stuck in traffic.

It's not so far.Just less than one kilometer.Go outside the community and walk up a short distance.right over there.
 - Do you think people will drive more in the future?

 - Do you prefer to chat with a group of people or with only one friend?
That's a good question.We all have our secret and we don't want to say that when have a chat with a group.But if we talk to our friends one by one.It's easier for us to say what we're hiding.So i like to chat with only one person instead of one group.
 - Do you prefer to communicate face-to-face or via social media?
For me,i would like to share myself face to face.Cuz we can have an interaction and watch what emotions another one have and figure out his or her feelings.It's a sign that help you with what you should talk about or avoid conflict with others.

Oh,absolutely not. I am not pretty romantic to choose the gifts that could catch one’s heart. It’s not what I am good at. Sometimes I would like to ask directly what others want. But that’s not a good idea.

 - Do you like to stay in a place with a lot of noise?
In my opinion, I don't believe anyone would choose to live in a noisy place, let alone like doing so. I can’t stand being exposed to noise for a long time, especially when studying. I think noise negatively impacts one's emotions and ability to focus. That’s not my thing. Therefore, I always try my best to avoid it.
 - What kinds of noise are there in the area where you live?
Well, let me think about it. There are redecoration and ceremony noises that I have suffered. I especially hate the redecoration noise, every time I try to take a short snap, the noise starts. Sometimes the redecoration starts in the early mornings, and I consequently can’t sleep well.

I definitely think so. That’s why I often go outside with my headphones on. It doesn't matter whether I’m commuting, shopping, studying, or just wandering, I just want to separate myself from the noise of the world. I don’t want to hear too many useless sounds.
 - Is making noise one of people's right?
Personally, I believe people are entitled to make sounds if they need to. However, they should always be cautious of and consider others' feelings, and give a warning if their sounds will disturb others. This demonstrates basic respect between people. We shouldn't do anything that we want, especially if it could harm others.

# Helping others

 - Do your parents teach you help to help others?
In their minds, just like what I think, before you try to help others, you need to make sure it won’t let you get hurt, then you can help them. Well, they are my parents and care about my safety first. I understand that.
 - Did your parents help you a lot when you were young?
 You know, in China, the dedication spirit of parents is more great than other relationships. They always try to give the best to their children. And my parents are the same kind of them, so they helped me a lot. I never doubt that.
 - What have you done to help the elderly?
The most common situation that happened to me was that I gave the elder a seat, another thing that I did was to lift the elder to walk for a short distance and avoid him from falling. To the best of my knowledge, that’s my help to the elder people.

# Run 
 - Do you go running a lot?
I went to sports ground running three times a week when I was in university. After I start working, I don’t have much free time for doing sports. Therefore, I’m not running frequently now. Sometimes I will go outside to wander after dinner.

Well, I will go to the sports ground and road behind the hill for running. I like to run on the track, I need to follow the direction of the runway and stick to it. It makes me feel like I’m in the right way.
 - When was the last time you went running?
I can’t remember it exactly. Perhaps when I was at home, I went to the track behind the hill and ran for more than 3 kilometers. I didn’t do sports for a long time at least half a year. I know that’s not good for my health. But I have too much to deal with.
 - What do you think of running as a sport?
Personally, I think it is a good sport for exercise that will benefit your body. I like to listen to music when I am running, it makes me feel relaxed. In my opinion, running is the most simple aerobic exercise for me. Therefore, I enjoy it.

It depends on where I wanna go, if I go to somewhere I am familiar with, I won’t use the maps. Cause I remembered the way I usually go. vice versa, when I need to go to places that I don’t know about, I will use the maps.
 - Do you have maps at home?
Of course I have, it is a world map hanging up on the wall but just for decoration now. When I was a child, I used that map to learn about geography knowledge and the positions of other countries. It can stand for one part of my childhood.

# Cakes
 - Do you like to eat cakes or other sweet foods?
Personally, I like to eat sweet food, of course, including cakes. But I don’t enjoy having too much. I’m afraid of taking calories over much. It will make me fat and I absolutely don’t want to be.
 - Did you like to eat cakes as a child?
S-ure thing. When I was a child, one of the most exciting days was someone’s birthday. we attend the celebration then we can get an opportunity to have cakes. You know, it was not easy for us to eat cakes when we were young.

Well, I had watched some baking videos on the internet, but unfortunately, I hadn’t tried to make cakes by myself before. Therefore, I can’t make cakes now.

If I were full, I wouldn’t have the appetite to have any other desserts. But after digesting food, I like to have some snacks just like desserts. I’m a snacker.

# Social media
 - When did you start using social media?
It was after I first had my smartphone when I was studying in high school. Just like opening a new world to me, l was like to make friends and chat with them. That is another way for me to talk with the world and keep up with the trend.
 - Do you think you spend too much time on social media?
I definitely think so. I should spend my time studying rather than wasting time on the useless social network. To be honest, it didn’t help me a lot. It’s a pity that I realized the truth so late. Sometimes I would feel regret when I recall it.
 - Do your friends use social media?
Of course, though we shouldn’t spend too much time on it. We need to know about news and information from others. In general, we will talk about the content from social media and have fun of it. That’s another entertainment way for us.
 - What do people often do on social media?
In my opinion, one part of people like to express and share their emotions, and others want to gain some useful information from it. But nowadays, plenty of people want to attract the mention of others and make money. enough attention would benefit them to earn profit.

# Video games
 - Do you play video games?
Well, video games play an important role when I growing up, I definitely do. And I often play video games with my friends. That’s one necessary way to relax and release stress for ourselves. Most of the children like playing video games as well as me. Sometimes I even can’t stop playing it.
 - Would you watch others play video games?
I have played online competitive games before and I tried my best to win the games. Therefore, I will watch some games live to learn playing methods. Honestly say that is a great way to play games well. On the other hand, I will watch videos for fun that show the amazing operation of players just like performance.
 - Do you think people spend too much time playing video games?
That’s a good question. For the children, they have to study and take lessons, and it surely takes up too much time for them.  But for professional players, playing games is what they live off. They need to practice more and play better for a good rank in the competitions, so, it’s normal for them.
 - Do you prefer playing video games alone or with others?
I like to play games with familiar people rather than playing alone. I can share my thoughts and experiences in the games. Obviously, playing together will be more fun so we want to call others to play with us. I think it is a nice way for you to communicate with one another through games. It can build up relationship between each other.

 - Have you ever lost your sunglasses?
Well, I even don’t have sunglasses. So, how can I lose that? It doesn’t make sense.

# Crowded place
 - Is the city where you live crowded?
In my opinion, Fuzhou is not as crowded as other big cities in China. And you know, people always like to stay in a wealthy city and make enough money to have a better life. And Fuzhou could not satisfy them.
 - Is there a crowded place near where you live?
If you want me to say, I would say that is Xiamen City. The smaller land and higher population density. Traffic jams are happening every day. I have been there before, it was true.

# Memory

Actually, I don’t think I am good at memorizing things. I can only remember what related to and impressed me. You know, we have limited memory and we should forget something useless for us. I can’t agree more.

Though I don’t want to admit it, I did before. I forgot to bring the bag with my important things and got off the bus. I was shocked and felt stressed. Fortunately, I found the bag back in the end.
 - What do you need to remember in your daily life?
Well, I think I need to brush my teeth before going to bed. And I should enhance my impression of the vocabulary that l learn every day. But the plan is always changing. I’m not sure what I should add to my daily schedule in the future. 
 - How do you remember important things?
That’s a good question, I often take the most easy way to remember things. I will repeat what I need to know or grasp and make it impress myself a lot. Perhaps I will ask my friends to tell me when I’m not sure I keep the events firmly in mind.

I am fine with singing for anyone. Because I believe that great music needs to be spread worldwide and shared with others. I think Music is a kind of language that you can use to express yourself.
 - Do you think singing can bring happiness to people?
I think it surely can. According to research, music can influence the emotions of others. When you hear songs that leave a lasting impression on you, it is just like meeting someone and striking a chord with them. Therefore, you will be excited about it.

# Money
 - Do you spend a lot of money?
My family is not that rich. My parents taught me at an early age how to be thrifty. Therefore, I didn’t, and still don't spend a lot of money. I will only pay for what is necessary to me and will avoid wasting money.
 - How do you save money?
I regularly deposit most of my earnings into my bank account. I am a conventional person and therefore believe the bank is the best place to store my money. However, after I learn more about finance and economics, I will try to put some of my money towards investments that will generate revenue for me in the future.

In addition, the PE lessons were the same for us as well. We would run around the sports ground three times then we had free time to exercise. And sometimes to attract the girls, boys liked playing basketball and showing high-level actions. Cause we thought it was cool. That was a consensus. When I was a kid, I often watched basketball competitions and cheered for athletes. It’s a sports spirit of humans. Every child has a dream about taking part in competitions and striving to be the champion. On the other hand, doing sports will benefit your health and make you energetic. Our parents also encouraged us to play basketball with others and they think it can help you get in touch with your friends well.

Personnally, I think the most popular activity is basketball. Almost every school has a basketball court for students. It’s convenient for us to play with our classmates. And just like what I said before, we all have the sports spirit.
 - At what time do children often have activities?
Nowadays, students have countless homework to finish, I think they rarely have time for entertainment. Perhaps they can only get free time at weekends. It’s a sad story.
 - What are the differences between activities at home and at school?
In school, you always want to play with your classmates. We aim to work together and be better. But when you are at home, your purpose is not the same, no partner, just yourself, you do exercises to build up your physical health. 
 - Why do some people like to participate in activities?
In my opinion, people like to join activities to enhance their relationships with others. And someone who likes to stay alone would not choose to take part in it. The most important meaning of activities is communication with society. At least for me, it is.

# Busy time
## keywords
 - word
 - overtime
 - client
 - tired
 - think about company
 - think about myself
## Part 2
Describe a period you were busy
 - When it was?
When I was asked to complete a very urgent work assignment, about half a year ago.
 - What you did during the period?
I need to develop a lot of web pages and test them by myself. Of course, overtime is indispensable.
 - What made you busy?
There weren’t enough front-end developers in our department at the time. I needed to finish all the tasks alone. Therefore, I was tired at that time.
 - And explain how you felt about the exprience?
Personally, I looked like a robot that keeps working and never stops. The client wanted to get the production in advance. And our company didn’t have an opportunity to say no as well as we couldn’t reject working overtime. If you don’t follow their orders, they will fire you. Well, that’s not a good experience for me. Fortunately, I haven’t experienced too much of that. Honestly, when I was focused on completing tasks and keeping up with them, I didn’t have time to think about my feelings. Finally, the tasks were done, and there was only one thought in my mind that was tired. Perhaps I didn’t like the job I had, so I didn’t be excited about what I did. Instead of making staff work overtime, I think the enterprise has responsibility with sensible time arrangement of workers. On the other hand, I still have many working skills to learn then improve my work efficiency and communication ability.
## Part 3
 - Why do people often feel tired in this day and age?
In my opinion, a society requires people to work together and dedicate themselves to running it. Just like Keep and Take, you want something that you need to pay in exchange. Therefore, if you want to keep your living condition at this time, you have to struggle for it.
 - Do you think people will feel even more tired in the future?
With the development of artificial technology, I don't think so. More and more workers will be replaced by robots and people can have plenty of free time to choose what kind of life they want.
 - Is time management important?
I’m an organized person and like to prepare a schedule for my time, so, I would say it is. Generally, I will assume the result that will happen in the future and then decide what to do. I hope everything is under control.
 - How does technology help with time management?
Think about the apps we use in our daily lives, we can mark our plans and targets in the electrical calendar and set the alarm to give a hint when we are busy. Certainly, office software tools can help us to finish our tasks efficiently. What I mentioned above is all technology.
 - Does technology distract people?
That’s a good question. Technology is like one kind of tool then you choose it to work with you. It depends on what you use to complete your assignments. If you put more attention on technology rather than the work you do, I think it does.

# Conversation with a old person
## Part2
 - Who this person is?
She is my grandma. And she is a Christian.
 - Where you had the conversation?
Before I went to university and joined a college fellowship, I didn’t know Christianity exactly. Therefore, my grandma always wants to encourage us to know and take part in Worship on Sundays. When she found that I had free time at weekends, she tried to share what she felt about religion with me at home.
 - What you talked about?
She told me how great Jesus is and how he saved the souls of human beings. The god had three in one, father, spirit, and son. Jesus is the son of the Father who was born as a person. And he suffered the pain and died due to the betrayal of one of his followers. People’s sins were cleansed through his death.
 - And explain how you felf about the exprience.
I remember when I first heard about this story about Jesus, I doubted how could be possible that the Father would let his son sacrifice for people that are full of sins. That was ridiculous for me at that time. Though I didn’t believe the story, I still trusted there was a god in the universe. Over time, the truth proved that my grandma was right. I tried to pray for my grades when I was studying at second school. It was just like a miracle happened to me, I changed my attitude towards learning and studied hard. Then I raised my grades quickly and felt excited about studying. Cause the rank of grades was important for me to let my family praise me. I always want to prove myself and make people satisfied with me.
## Part3
 - How do people have a conversation with an elderly person?
It depends on who you talk with. If you are talking with the elder people in your family, you generally will care about his or her health and share your experience. But for other elder people, you will ask them what you need to do for them. Because we seldom talk with older people in life. The most common situation is that they seek help and there we are.

# Helping others
## part2
 - Who you helped?
I helped with a girl who was still studying at university.
 - Why you helped him/her?
Her parents asked me to have a conversation with their daughter and try to give her some suggestions. Cause they felt their daughter didn’t like to listen to what they said.
 - How you helped with him/her?
When I first met her, I didn’t talk to her. That was on Sunday, we had to worship. In the end, we had lunch together and I sat beside her and talked about the problem with her English. She needs to pass the IELTS exam as well as me. Therefore, I talked to her about grammar, vocabulary, and practice. I told her about my experience and shared my notes of lessons with her.
 - And explain how you felt about the experience.
I didn’t think too much about the role and characters of her. I just tried to help her which I regard as one of my siblings. She is a Christian too. Through the Bible, we learn that we should help each other between people. And you should try your best to love those around you first. Of course, she is. And it was just like magic, I felt enjoyable when I was helping and talking with her. Perhaps that’s why most Christians would be friendly to others. we know that Father will approve of what we do. When we got this point, we feel released and we want to do so. Our priest often tells us to be the light and salt of the world. I can’t agree more but I know that is extremely difficult.
## part3
 - Should people be very kind when they help others?
Well, as a Christian, I think so. Cause we want to follow Jesus who was friendly when he helped others. We need to switch our perspective, if you are looking for help, you want to see a happy or a bad face.
 - Should children be taught to be kind to others?
I definitely agree that they have to. It’s still the same for us, do you wish that you would get help when you need it? Do as you do, and be treated as you are. However, that’s your choice, no one will force you.
 - How do you compare kindness with other qualities?
I will compare ability with kindness, we were often taught that bad guys shouldn’t have power, they will crimes and cause horrible things to society. In my opinion, before you as an excellent person, you should be a kind person first.

# Unusual holiday
## Part2
 - When and where you went
 - Who you went with
 - What you did there
 - And explain why it was unusual
I remember that was Christmas Eve and Sunday. I and my siblings had an amazing day. Firstly, we worshipped in the studio of a teacher in the morning, then we ordered food delivery and had lunch together. After the meal, we took part in a performance in which we sang and the children played instruments for us. Everybody was very happy and shared their feelings. About 3 hours later, the activity was over, I and some of my siblings went to the mall to shop. I followed them and visited the clothing store in the mall, when they were trying on clothes, I gave them advice on what I felt. But we didn’t spend too much time on this, we also had dinner and attended an Online music concert. We enjoyed the show and took snacks, just like a whole family celebrating Christmas. The wonderful music programs made us can’t help to follow and sing with them. Happiness was around us. I think I won’t forget that day we experienced. I’m glad I have many siblings to celebrate the festival with. And this day is my birthday as well, finally, we had a delicious cake and completed our celebration. On the way back, I was still recalling the wonderful experience of that day. That was my first time attending the Online concert on Christmas Eve. And I made many new friends. I wish I had more opportunities to participate in such activities.
## Part3
 - Do you think people in your country have long enough holidays?
It is impossible. In my view, we don’t have many holidays each year. I have heard lots of colleagues complain that they don’t have enough time for rest. They also aren’t satisfied with the holiday arrangement.
 - Which holidays are popular in your country?
Though You don’t know about other holidays. You can’t not know the spring festival in China. That is the longest vacation in our country and related to our culture. People often get together as a family on holidays of spring festival. They usually have a great time with each other and celebrate the coming of a new year.
 - Are there any popular places for holidays in your country?
I don’t travel very often, therefore, I don’t know that much about resorts for holidays. To the best of my knowledge, people perhaps like to visit some famous places like Disney or the Imperial Palace to spend their vacations.
 - What are the differences between old and young people when spending their holidays?
My grandma doesn’t like going outside with us when we are on weekends or holidays. She said that she liked the peacetime at that age. But young people, always like going shopping or traveling around the whole country rather than staying at home. They like to visit more places that they think are worth it.
 - Do you think having holidays help people learn other counties' cultures?
I definitely think so. People usually use festivals to commemorate some special days that stand for other meanings. When we celebrate their holidays, we are supposed to know why we want to spend time on these holidays. The holidays would help people from different countries to communicate with their cultures.
 - Why do some people dislike holidays?
Everyone should have their hobbies. Perhaps he loves his job or he just wants to stay the status everlasting. And they may want to earn more money for what they need. It’s all possible.

# Complain
## Part2
 - When and where it happened
 - What he/she complained about
 - What the result was
 - And explain how you felt about the experience
My father is a driver, working in a cultural travel company, his job is to take people to the location required by customers in the city, about two years ago, my father told me at dinner that someone complained about him because he could not speed up the car as required by customers and made inappropriate remarks, he was complained by customers, the company deducted his salary of 50 yuan. He complained about it for a long time. After I heard his story, I told my dad he needed to adjust his speech style. I think people in the service industry are supposed to be friendly, but my dad made an inappropriate statement when he told customers they should take a taxi if they want to be fast. Such remarks are not suitable for him to say. I think when we talk to others, we should switch different angles to look at the problem, not just express our point of view. In addition, I have to learn about communication skills that could benefit me in talking with others. I found that I still have a long way to go. We can’t stop studying and making progress every day. Therefore, stay hungry, stay foolish. I love this sentence. That’s reasonable, right?
## Part3
 - How do companies train their staff to deal with complains?
As far as I know, there is a saying that the customer is God. Companies usually ask their employees to try their best to meet the needs of customers, so they need to stabilize the emotions of customers the first time and assess The level of the complaint. with lower-level cases handled directly by the employee and higher-level cases referred to the supervisor.
 - What do people usually complain about?
People often complain about discrimination and poor service. Others will complain about the quality of some goods, these are relatively common situations. But the same point is that they are dissatisfied because the service is different from their psychological expectations.
 - How do most people complain,in writing or by other methods?
In China, most services or goods have the contact information of the supplier, with the development of science and technology, almost everyone has a mobile phone, people prefer to complain by phone instead of writing letters.

# Outdoor activity
## Part2
 - What the activity was?
 - When and where you did it?
 - Who you did it with?
 - And explain why you enjoyed it.
I like to listen to music while running outside. I usually run on the mountain road near my home about four times a week. I always go running alone. I don't have anyone to exercise with. For me, running is the easiest and most relaxing aerobic exercise, and I can think about all kinds of things while running. I am not used to running on the treadmill, I prefer to go to the outdoor environment is better for exercise, especially near the mountain track, because there are trees, and the air quality is very good. When I run to the top of the hill, I can also look at the scenery below. Looking at the beautiful scenery often makes me feel happy. Many people are running there like me, and the sight of everyone working out together always inspires me. Since I sit and study for a long time, running in the mountains can relax me and enhance my physique, which is very helpful for me to adjust my study state. I prefer to go out and exercise rather than at home, there is more space outside and it is easier to let your heart open. If you meet people who share the same interests as you, you can also make friends with them and communicate with them about life, which is also helpful for my communication skills.
## Part3
 - Do people go outdoors more or less now?
I think nowadays people use electronic devices more at home, and only a few people will exercise, let alone go out to exercise. And some people also choose to go to the gym, so it is not easy to find someone to go outdoors with you.
 - What can people do outdoors besides exercising?
In addition to sports, people can also watch the scenery, observe the beauty of nature, and admire the wonder of the creator. Some people like to see the behavior of animals, which gives them a feeling of vitality. It’s awesome.

# Do something hurry
## Part2
 - what it was?
 - When it happened?
 - Why you had to do it quickly?
 - And explain how you felt about it.
Around my winter vacation at university, I booked a train ticket from Shenzhen City to go home for the Spring Festival which is the most popular traditional festival in China. People usually get together as a family and celebrate the festival. However, due to a long stay with friends, I arrived at the station shortly before the departure time.  there are so many people in the station, we need to queue up to get into the station, but I am very anxious to get in and check the ticket, the check-in time will be over soon. So I kept apologizing to the persons in front of me and pushed my way forward. Finally, I managed to get on the train a few minutes before departure, which was very extreme. As it is very difficult to buy a ticket during the Spring Festival travel rush, I dare not imagine what I would face if I missed the ticket. Luckily, I managed to get on the train at last. It also gave me an inspiration that no matter what you do, you need to reserve some time to prepare for things that have not yet happened.
## Part3
 - On what occasions do people have to do things in a hurry?
People tend to rush before the deadline, especially if it's important to them or has a big impact on them. Most people focus on what's happening at the moment. Because there is no way to predict future events accurately.
 - Why do some people spend a long time on having a meal?
In modern life, there are many people will play on mobile phones while eating, they usually watch videos or watch some news, which generally extends the time they eat. Anyway, that’s not a good habit.
 - Would people feel more satisfied if they finished doing somethings quickly?
If they are doing it happily, then probably not. On the contrary, if they hate it so much, they'll want to end what they're doing quickly. They are likely to be satisfied, as they wish.
# Use a map
## Part2
 - When you used the map?
 - Where you were?
 - Why you used a map?
 - And explain how you felt about the experience.
I usually use a map when looking up directions to my destination. Could have been at home or outside. Since I can't find the way or am not familiar with the route, I will need a map to guide me to the correct and most convenient route. I believe that most people use maps to find the route that suits them, and maps have become increasingly important in our lives. In particular, with some electronic maps, people through GPS to locate their location and destination, calculate the feasible program and travel time, and then make their next travel plan. This makes travel easier for everyone. People can also look at some things around the map to see if there is a place to meet their requirements. With the development of science and technology, maps have become more and more diverse, and more new functions will enter our lives in the future. Just as we couldn't imagine how widely smartphones are used in our daily lives.
## Part3
 - What do people usually do when they get lost?
I think when people get lost, they seek help from people around them or use navigation to guide their way. There may be some people who use the compass to determine the direction of travel, but due to the widespread use of maps, such people will be less and less.
 - What are the differences between paper and digital maps?
Paper maps need to be carried out and are updated relatively infrequently due to cost issues. Electronic maps are installed on the phone, which is very easy to use, and there is also software to help you make better travel choices.
 - What do you think of in-car GPS navigation systems?
These systems are like the maps we use in our daily lives. It can be more convenient for drivers to use, and I think it's because drivers need these navigation systems that cars are now equipped with them.
 - What do people often do with a map?
As I mentioned before, people often use maps to locate themselves and their destinations, and use software to figure out different ways to travel and choose from them. 
 - Why do most people prefer to use a paper map?
I think there may be two reasons, one is because people think the design of paper maps is more beautiful, and another is that paper maps do not rely on electronic devices and do not worry about power problems.
 - How does learning to read a map help you learn more about your country?
Learning to read maps can help us understand the surface of a country and how densely populated its cities are. In the same way, we can use maps to judge the size of cities and the climate, which helps us understand the geography of a country.

# Noise
## Part2
 - Where you heard the noise?
 - Who made the noise?
 - How you reacted to the noise?
 - And explain how you felt about the noise.
I think there is a lot of noise in places like the food market, for example, a market near my home. Every morning, many people bring fresh vegetables and meat to sell, and people are willing to get up early to buy fresh ingredients. When you walk in, before you see the goods, you hear the stall owner yelling at the people around him to buy things there. And you can hear buyers bargaining with sellers until they reach a reasonable price. I'm not used to noise, so I usually go in with my headphones on, so I'm not affected by it. I think voices like this show us how ordinary people face life and support their families through their actions. This is not quite the same as in modern big cities, where people usually go to the supermarket to buy their daily necessities and cannot bargain in the supermarket. Being in a supermarket can be quieter than a food market, which can make you feel like there's no one around. However, the voice of people animates the food market. But at the same time， it makes me feel strange because I don't think I belong to their group. As I have lived in the big city for a long time, I will enjoy living in a quiet environment.
## Part3
 - What kinds of places should be noise-free?
I think in some serious public places like libraries or offices, there should be no noise. Because your voice will obviously affect other people's studies or work. This is not a good thing for others.
 - Can people bring children to these noise-free places?
Of course, people can take children to these places, but before taking them there. You should teach them not to disturb others, or you will be responsible for the behavior of your children.
 - Why can't people make noise in a church?
In the church, people need to concentrate on worship, people's noise will disturb the behavior of the believers, but also belong to a kind of disrespect for the God in their hearts, I think this is the main reason.
 - What public morals should people follow in your country?
In public places, people are usually asked not to smoke or do some impolite behavior. Including making noise, this will be opposed and stopped by everyone. We all want to create a good environment and we are working on it.

# Skill learned as a teenager
## Part2
 - What the skill is?
 - When and how you learned it?
 - Who you learned it from?
 - And explain why to learned it.
When I was young, my mother took me to the swimming pool to find a swimming coach to teach me how to swim. I was studying with a couple of my peers, and we had to do a warm-up exercise before we got in the water, we started with the basics of swimming, and then we were supervised in the water which kept us safe. It helps us learn to swim by getting familiar with the movements and practicing more in the water. Of course, communicating with friends and monitoring each other is also very useful. Since we live in a city near the ocean, my mother thinks we must learn to swim in case we need to. This skill will increase our chances of surviving a flood. Also, swimming is a very good sport, when you swim, all parts of your body are active. It is very good for our health. At that time, I was not willing to learn at first, but as I gradually became familiar with this sport, I loved swimming with my friends. On the other hand, I also made a lot of friends. For me, the days when I learned to swim are still my beautiful memories.
## Part3
 - Where do children learn skills in your country?
In our country, parents usually teach their children skills by themselves. Most children's skills are taught by their parents because parents need to teach children how to live independently and take care of themselves. And children generally have more trust in their parents.
 - What are the differences between learning skills on your own and from others?
I think I don't like to recite some theoretical knowledge, I am more accustomed to practice after learning the process. This will help me to familiarize myself with the skill. But I don't think it's significantly different from anyone else.
 - What important skills should a child learn?
The first thing children need to learn is life skills, how to survive and protect themselves. These are the most basic skills for a child to grow up. Like cooking, dressing, and recognizing danger.
 - What skills do you think teenagers should have?
For me, I think a teenager should learn how to face all kinds of difficulties and challenges. Because on his way growing up, many unexpected things will happen to hinder him, he should keep his mind and try to overcome these accidents.
 - Who should teach teenageers skills?
I think parents should take primary responsibility for the growth of teenagers. Before a child becomes an adult, parents have to teach a child how to deal with the troubles in life and encourage them.
 - What are the differences between children learning skills and adults learning skills?
Children often need an adult to guide and protect them as they learn skills. But adults more often need to learn alone and to pay for their knowledge of the corresponding price. That’s the biggest difference..

# Long-term goal
## Part2
 - How long you have had this goal?
 - What the goal is?
 - How you will achieve it?
 - And explain why you set this goal.
About 9 months ago, I made a plan to study abroad. This requires me to get a good IELTS score, so I have set up various study plans and goals. First, I found a private English teacher to help me judge my current level and areas that needed extra attention. In the course, I learned a lot of skills and was encouraged by the teachers. I feedback on my practice results and questions to the teacher so that the teacher can understand my learning process and make the next study plan. The teacher sent me a lot of potentially useful materials, and I continued to practice and summarize according to my daily plan. Fortunately, my level gradually improved, but after one test I tried, my score was still not up to my goal. Therefore, I can only find out the shortcomings again and continue to improve in this area. When I was working, I thought that I should not stay in a comfortable state for a long time. The goal of studying abroad is a great challenge for me, which urges me to learn and grow all the time. In my opinion, under such pressure, I can be more motivated to overcome my difficulties. So I made this goal to improve myself and get out of this situation.
## Part3
 - What goals should a society have?
I think society should set some goals aimed at protecting the surrounding environment and maintaining the quality of people. Protecting the environment we live in and creating a good social atmosphere is what everyone should try to do.
 - Do people need to have goals?
I think people need to set some goals. This can help give them hints when they don't know what to do and give them clear directions. They can also be encouraged to work hard to achieve a goal when it is not already done.
 - What goals do people your age have?
At my age, people should try to grow and improve themselves. You shouldn't waste your time on too much entertainment. We should know the meaning of our life and the goal of our struggle.
 - Is it necessary to give advice to children?
Proper guidance is necessary for children. We should teach children how to distinguish good from bad and lead them to grow up healthily. Every sincere piece of advice has the potential to be a blessing for your child's future.
 - What goals do young people usually have?
When I was in university, I hoped to find a stable and well-paying job, get married, and start a family of my own as soon as possible. I guess most young people feel the same way. People always want to live peacefully and safely.
 - What should people do to achieve their goals?
People need to judge whether their current state can achieve the goal before making the plan, and then it is best to find a partner or family member to help remind them after making the goal. Keep yourself in the right direction.

# Useful Object In Your Home
## Part2
 - How long you have had it?
 - What you can do with it?
 - How often you use it?
 - And explain why you cannot live without it.
It's been almost four years since I bought this laptop. I use it for work, entertainment, watching movies, and so on. I use my computer every day. With the development of science and technology, almost every family has at least one computer. Whether in the workplace or daily life, people's lives are inseparable from computers. We can use computers to connect to the Internet, search for the information we need, and find people related to us. Not only cell phones can be used to communicate, but people can also communicate with each other through computers. And computers have more functions than mobile phones. In modern times, we can't imagine what life would be like without computers. The computer has brought great contributions to human beings, and it is still developing. In particular, I am a software development engineer, and my work requires a lot of use of computers for development every day. For me, computers are an essential tool. I might have only used my computer to play games before, but now it has more ways for me to use it. In any case, the future development of AI will have a greater impact on people's lives, before entering an intelligent machine age, we need to understand and how to use computers. Because AI is one type of computer that is constantly learning.
## Part3
 - What equipment do you find difficult to use?
I think television is becoming less and less useful to us now. Whether we want to watch TV series or movies, we can find the resources we need through the computer and watch them on the Internet. It's much more convenient than a TV set.
 <!-- - What can you do with a laptop? -->
 - What are the benefits of using technology in the workplace?
For example, in my development process, using a convenient framework for development can save a lot of time for repetitive work. Using technology can improve the efficiency and quality of my work. Computers are much less likely to make mistakes than humans.
 - Why do some people in the workplace dislike technology?
Some people work more to get in touch with people's ideas. They don't need too much technology to solve problems, they need more communication skills. Technology doesn't work in some jobs.
 - Why do people buy a lot of household appliances?
People prefer that these boring chores can be done by machines so that they have more time to do what they want to do or should do. There are many companies in this area continue to develop new products to benefit people's lives.
 - What do people often do with electronic devices?
They are often used for things that have specific procedures and don't require cooperation with a human. Because things that require human involvement are often too complex to be solved simply with electronic products.

# Interested in
## Part2
 - What it is?
 - Why you are interested in it?
In China, the most attractive place for me is undoubtedly my hometown, Quanzhou. It is a beautiful and livable city. In recent years, the population of Quanzhou has increased a lot. Quanzhou is becoming popular all over the country. It is not a big city, but it has the unique charm of a small city. In this city, you don't need to live at a fast pace, people's life is not under very high pressure. You can choose the lifestyle you like best. Everyone can find their meaning in this city. I lived in Quanzhou City until I went to university. There are my family, friends, classmates, and my childhood memories. When I was young, I often ran to the street to eat snacks, Quanzhou has so many kinds of snacks, sometimes I even don't know what to eat. Another advantage is that there are so many scenic areas here, every day on your way to work you can often see some spectacular sights, which often make people on the road feel happy. Walking through the city streets, you can always see people talking or shopping. It's a vibrant city, where people are very friendly and willing to help each other, and where the culture is so deep and there are so many religious types that everyone who comes here doesn't have to worry about fitting in.

# Public Facility
## Part2
 - What the facility is?
 - When it was renovated and improved?
 - What has been renovated and improved?
 - And explain how you feel about it.
With the development of traffic, it is more and more convenient for people to travel. Most commendable is China's high-speed rail system. It has been in use for 20 years, during which it is constantly optimized and improved. Early trains were powered by raw steam and coal, but high-speed trains were powered by electricity. This not only reduces environmental pollution but also increases the speed of movement. In the past few decades, we have felt the convenience brought by the improvement of the transportation system, which has also provided a very big contribution to the economy. Communication and trade between cities became less difficult. In the past, if you wanted to go to another province or even another city, you would have to go to the station early to buy a bus ticket and sit on the bus for a long time waiting for the bus to arrive at the destination. Most people often can not adapt to such a way of travel. However, the emergence of high-speed rail has greatly shortened the time for people to travel between cities. Now we only need to buy tickets online, and then carry our ID card to the station to swipe the code, you can enter and ride. This optimization is a good news for everyone. When you want to go to a city but you are worried about the cost of the air ticket, you can choose to take the bullet train. During the Spring Festival every year, bullet train tickets are very popular. If you don't book your ticket in advance, it will be difficult to get a ticket at the time you want to ride. It can be known from the news that the routes of bullet trains are still expanding continuously. I believe that in the future, we will have more opportunities to visit remote cities by bullet trains. That day cannot be far away.

# Help work or study
## Part2
 - What it is?
 - When and where you do it?
 - How you do ti?
 - And explain how you feel about it.
In my opinion, whether in work or study, we need to control and manage our time. A short break in the middle is very important for everyone. Sometimes when I think, I can't think of the key idea, but when I get out of that state and rest, the idea in my brain will suddenly appear. It's an amazing. This also means that the pause in the middle of the course not only won’t block the long-term goal but also will help. There is a saying in China called 'haste makes waste', which means that when you want to do something, the more you want to finish it quickly, the more easily you will rush and cause the failure of the thing. No matter what you do, you need a process, and no success is purely accidental. In addition, taking short breaks is also good for your mental state. When you are thinking in the long term, your brain is not able to handle the stress, which may affect your ability to come up with solutions to problems. For me, I usually stop for a few minutes, listen to a song, and get some fresh air before I dive back into what I'm doing. Every time I take a break for a while, my work efficiency improves and my mind becomes active. But when I focus on one thing for too long, my performance deteriorates, so I need to take a break to avoid this state.

# Job you don't like
## Part2
 - How you know about the job?
 - Whether the job is difficult or not?
 - And explain why you would not like to do it.
When I graduated from high school, I had two months of summer vacation, my parents asked me to work in a factory to earn some money. So I went to a factory that hired temporary workers through my uncle's recommendation and started working. The job is to operate continuously in a specified process to ensure that subsequent procedures are not delayed. It was not difficult for me, and I quickly got used to the pace of work. But as time passed, I began to get impatient, because I thought what I did was not so different from a machine. It made me feel like what I did was worthless and boring. I don't like this kind of work, especially if it needs to be maintained for a long time and it is difficult to get the chance to rest. I think a job should have different things, difficulties, and directions, which can help me to continuously improve my work skills and work efficiency. I prefer thinking about how to solve problems rather than repetitive physical work. With the development of AI, simple jobs without complex rules will sooner or later be replaced by robots. This kind of work is very risky and does not highlight the individual's strengths or characteristics. Each worker only needs to understand part of the program and then continue to execute it. In my opinion, this kind of work is very suitable for computers to do. For example, I developed a program to test software using a computer through a script, and the test is faster and more reliable than a human. Therefore, it is unlikely that I will engage in such work in the future.
