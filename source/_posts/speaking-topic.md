The job is about coding the web page.We take design drawing and we achieve it.
We will talk to the back end and designer for better experience of Customers.
We care about the efficiency and functions of the web page.It is not easy for us to learn improving efficiency of system.We request the data and draw it on the web page.It just like you are one creater and you are creating your masterpiece.That's awesome.we always feel satisfied about the prosess.And the salary is not bad too.Actually i was raised in China,we all accepted the exam oriented education.It cause that we don't know what we want and we real love to do after graduation.We just choose the industry we really familiar to.

My hobby is Music and Games.My life can't without the Music.I listen to several styles of Music.The melodic progressive house is my favorite.I just enjoy the melody.And BPM(Beat Per Minute) of that style is about 120 to 130.

# Hometown
 - Where are you from?
I am from FuJian province,QuanZhou City.It's a southeast city of China and opposite to TaiWan.In my views,that's a beautiful city which worth you to travel here.
 - How long have you been living there?
I have been living here beforn i went to university.I spend my childhood in this city.
 - Is your hometown a big city or a small city?
My hometown is just a small city.It don't have enough population just like the other big cities,and Of course its economic.
 - Do you like your hometown?
There is no doubt that i like my born place.I have friends and parents here.Besides,i like its climate and culture.People live here don't need to speed up(accelerate) their pace of life.Work life balance is the best choice for me.
 - Are there anything you dislike about your hometown?
On the one hand,it's difficult for you to be employed(get a job) here,you need to learn
skills that are suitable for the needs of others.On the other hand,the cost of life is not low here.Perhaps you will worry about the expenses of food and accomodation.
 - Has your hometown changed over the years?What are the changes?
Actually,i don't find many changes here.A lot taller and modern buildings are erected.And the transportation is more convenient than past.The high speed railway develops rapidly.That's all i think about.
 - Do you think you will continue living there for a long time?
It's my pleasure to live here.But if i have the opportunity to live in another city,i think i will move to there for working and strive to my career.I don't want to limit myself in just one city.I want to exprience different lifestyles in this world.

# Work or Study
 - Are you a student or are you working right now?
I have graduated for over three years.So,definitely,I am working now.
 - What's your favourite subject?
I enjoy physical education mostly.When you have seated for a long time,perhaps you need to go outside for a walk.It means the relaxation for myself.And i would like to listen music when i was doing sports.That always makes me feel amazing.
 - Why did you choose this major?Who helped you to choose this major?
Firstly,i am familiar to computers.On the other hand,this subject can make me easier to get a job.There is a large market gap in this industry.Before i choose this major,my uncle had told me about the situation.So that's why.
 - What was your first day at shcool like?
When i first arrived my university,i visited the scene around it.The fresh air,greens,smooth road an so on.All the things i have seen all made me comfortable.I was looking forward to meet my new friends at that time.That's a shining and perfect day.
 - How much time do you spend on studying every day?
For now,i spend at least 5 hours on learning and practice daily.I wanna improve my personal ability and level.This is a suitable age for me to work hard.I don't want my youth to be meaningless.
 - What do you like most about your study?
I like to divide my goals into different slice of tasks and make them as a to-do list.Everytime i finish my small task,i feel a sense of accomplistment.Just like you overcome something and it means you are more close to your dream.
 - Does your major/study live up to your expectation?
Well,that's a good question,i thought it was easy for me to learn about this major,but all subjects and term arrangement made me stressful.It means i need to study hard and prepare for the exams or classes.Fortuantely,i grew up a lot.So 70% perhaps.
 - Which do you prefer,studying in the morning or in the afternoon?
There is one idiom here we usually say,morning hours is the best time of the day to do work.Obviously,i enjoy studying in the morning than afternoon.My mind will be more clearly at that time.
 - Which do you prefer,studying alone or with others?
Well,i fancy studying with others.I think communication is still the best way to learn something or improve yourself.Cuz the power and ability of indiviual is always finite.On the other hand,it is hard for me to keep in studying alone,and the others might encourage me a lot.That's not bad.
 - What kind of subjects are often considered as challenging?
In my mind,some subjects will be difficult for me,like mathematics,operation system,calculus etc.You need to stay focus on the content and think logically.But sometimes my mind wanders and that's not a good sign.Once i miss the important part of it,i will feel terrible about this.
 - Would it be better to study science subjects?
No,i don't think that is a good choice for everyone.We all have our perferences.It is also significant for us to keep our culture,spirit and religion.And all of these are not about science subjects.We need to learn knowledge that will works at the reality.But keep yourself in a mental heath is necessary too.
 - Speaking of studying,who matters more,teachers or classmates?
Actually,there is no need to seperate and set a  different important levels for them.They are all the same to me.Everyone can be my teacher too.The significance is what i can learn from he or she.That's the real meaning for me.
 - Do you like your job?
My job is web developer,my duty is to design and code the webpages,it feels like you are creating something that is useful and beautiful for users.That's amazing,so i choose that work and satisfied with it.
 - What do you find most interesting about your work/job?
You know,when we are coding,we usually need to adjust elements of webpages and decide what color,size,font to use.It just like sulpturing,every steps you have done make your masterpiece more perfect.It make sense to me.That's my favorite part.
 - What is the most important quality of a co-worker/colleague?
I think the spirit of cooperation is the most significant.If you and your workmates don't aim to the same goal and stick together,it is hard for a team to give out the result that is valuable and satisfactory.That's lethal for a group.
 - Which matters to you more,the job itself or the people you work with?
Acutally it is hard for me to set the level with that.They are all important to me,the awlful work or terrible colleagues both make me feel bad.And i believe that will influence my work status for a whole day.
 - Have you ever changed your work before?
No,i have never chanaged my job.For me,i think i still have a long way to go and i need to improve my work skills.In my mind,it's not the good choice to change the job frequently.If you don't spend enough time and keep on what you do,you are hardly successful with anything.
