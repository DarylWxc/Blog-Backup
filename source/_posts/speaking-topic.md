I have been living here beforn i went to university.I spend my childhood in this city.

My hometown is just a small city.It don't have enough population just like the other big cities,and Of course its economic.
 - Do you like your hometown?
There is no doubt that i like my born place.I have friends and parents here.Besides,i like its climate and culture.People live here don't need to speed up(accelerate) their pace of life.Work life balance is the best choice for me.
 - Are there anything you dislike about your hometown?
On the one hand,it's difficult for you to be employed(get a job) here,you need to learn
skills that are suitable for the needs of others.On the other hand,the cost of life is not low here.Perhaps you will worry about the expenses of food and accomodation.

 - What is the most important quality of a co-worker/colleague?
I think the spirit of cooperation is the most significant.If you and your workmates don't aim to the same goal and stick together,it is hard for a team to give out the result that is valuable and satisfactory.That's lethal for a group.
 - Which matters to you more,the job itself or the people you work with?
Acutally it is hard for me to set the level with that.They are all important to me,the awlful work or terrible colleagues both make me feel bad.And i believe that will influence my work status for a whole day.
 - Have you ever changed your work before?
No,i have never chanaged my job.For me,i think i still have a long way to go and i need to improve my work skills.In my mind,it's not the good choice to change the job frequently.If you don't spend enough time and keep on what you do,you are hardly successful with anything.
 - Do you think you will change your job in the future?
I think i might change my job later.You know,people's mind changing all the time that my thoughts too.Perhaps when i arrived my thirties,i will have different decisions and change my lifestyle.And i believe i won't be work like now at that time.

I will never forget the first day i went to work.Obviously,i felt nervous and shy.And we usually don't need to do the real work in the beginning.Cuz you need to trained and ready for your job.And i spend some time on getting familiar with the people and facilites around me.And my colleagues helped me a lot,i was grateful to them.
 - What do you want your company to improve?
In my opinion,the time arrangement perhaps need to be more flexible.People nowadays have lots of personal things to do.If we  have enough for solving the problem of life and get nice work status,It will be a good news for everyone.In addition,some limitations and rules should be also set for it,the boundary must be reasonable.
 - What kind of jobs are popular in China?
As i know,people like doctor,teacher and agent would be more popular.Cuz we always think they look decent.Most of us want to have a stable job like that,if you have it,you will even praised a lot from your family and neighors.
 - Would you like to go to another country to work?
Sure thing.If i have a chance,i will.The world is so big for me,and i don't want to be limited in just one country.There are lots of things that i want to explore and experience.Life is just once,don't waste your time and opportunities.

In my view,the house don't need to be too big,enough is just ok.The most important factor is who you live with.I want to have a house with second floor and my family is all here.When i finish my daily work,i back home and get into it,then i feel relax and pleased.Cuz i know,that's my home.

 - What are some changes in the area recently?

 - What's the most popular meas of transpotation in your hometown?
Actually the transpotation of my hometown is not that convenient.There is no subway.We often go out by electric bike or bus.We don't really like driving,it's easy to get stuck in traffic.

It's not so far.Just less than one kilometer.Go outside the community and walk up a short distance.right over there.
 - Do you think people will drive more in the future?

That's a good question.We all have our secret and we don't want to say that when have a chat with a group.But if we talk to our friends one by one.It's easier for us to say what we're hiding.So i like to chat with only one person instead of one group.
 - Do you prefer to communicate face-to-face or via social media?
For me,i would like to share myself face to face.Cuz we can have an interaction and watch what emotions another one have and figure out his or her feelings.It's a sign that help you with what you should talk about or avoid conflict with others.

Personally, I don’t have too much chance to receive a gift. Therefore, every time the gift I get means that I am pretty happy. That’s a great gift. I’m concerned more about who blesses you.

Well, I will think about what another will need more. The most important point is the meaning of gifts which represent your heart. If you are intimate with him or her, you will focus on what he likes and wants.
 - Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?
Oh,absolutely not. I am not pretty romantic to choose the gifts that could catch one’s heart. It’s not what I am good at. Sometimes I would like to ask directly what others want. But that’s not a good idea.

# Noise
 - Do you like to stay in a place with a lot of noise?
In my opinion, I don't believe anyone would choose to live in a noisy place, let alone like doing so. I can’t stand being exposed to noise for a long time, especially when studying. I think noise negatively impacts one's emotions and ability to focus. That’s not my thing. Therefore, I always try my best to avoid it.
 - What kinds of noise are there in the area where you live?
Well, let me think about it. There are redecoration and ceremony noises that I have suffered. I especially hate the redecoration noise, every time I try to take a short snap, the noise starts. Sometimes the redecoration starts in the early mornings, and I consequently can’t sleep well.
 - Do you want to move to a quieter place?
I definitely want to, although the unfortunate reality is that I don't have enough money to move somewhere quieter. Therefore, Even though I hate the noise, I have to bear it. However, I believe that one day I will significantly improve my current living conditions.
 - Do you think there is too much noise in today's world?
I definitely think so. That’s why I often go outside with my headphones on. It doesn't matter whether I’m commuting, shopping, studying, or just wandering, I just want to separate myself from the noise of the world. I don’t want to hear too many useless sounds.
 - Is making noise one of people's right?
Personally, I believe people are entitled to make sounds if they need to. However, they should always be cautious of and consider others' feelings, and give a warning if their sounds will disturb others. This demonstrates basic respect between people. We shouldn't do anything that we want, especially if it could harm others.

# Helping others
 - Do you usually help people around you?
Well, I don’t often help people around me, in our culture, we rarely seek help from others. but if I meet one person who calls for help and I can do that, I would like to give him or her a hand. Before I choose to help others, I have to make sure it won’t cause damage to me.
 - How do you usually help people around you,such as neighbours,family and friends?
When I was a child, I often be asked to do the housework for my family, it just took me a short time, and I usually accepted it. Sometimes my dad will let me help with him about operation of a smartphone which he doesn’t know a lot about but I am more familiar than him, so I do it.
 - Do your parents teach you help to help others?
In their minds, just like what I think, before you try to help others, you need to make sure it won’t let you get hurt, then you can help them. Well, they are my parents and care about my safety first. I understand that.
 - Did your parents help you a lot when you were young?
 You know, in China, the dedication spirit of parents is more great than other relationships. They always try to give the best to their children. And my parents are the same kind of them, so they helped me a lot. I never doubt that.
 - What have you done to help the elderly?
The most common situation that happened to me was that I gave the elder a seat, another thing that I did was to lift the elder to walk for a short distance and avoid him from falling. To the best of my knowledge, that’s my help to the elder people.

# Run 
 - Do you go running a lot?
I went to sports ground running three times a week when I was in university. After I start working, I don’t have much free time for doing sports. Therefore, I’m not running frequently now. Sometimes I will go outside to wander after dinner.
 - Where do you usually go running?
Well, I will go to the sports ground and road behind the hill for running. I like to run on the track, I need to follow the direction of the runway and stick to it. It makes me feel like I’m in the right way.
 - When was the last time you went running?
I can’t remember it exactly. Perhaps when I was at home, I went to the track behind the hill and ran for more than 3 kilometers. I didn’t do sports for a long time at least half a year. I know that’s not good for my health. But I have too much to deal with.
 - What do you think of running as a sport?
Personally, I think it is a good sport for exercise that will benefit your body. I like to listen to music when I am running, it makes me feel relaxed. In my opinion, running is the most simple aerobic exercise for me. Therefore, I enjoy it.

# Map
 - Do you often use maps?
Well, I always use the maps when I go outside. I can’t remember all the streets or the roads I have been through before. Obviously, I need the maps to direct myself to which way is right for my destination.
 - Do you use paper maps?
No, I think the map apps will be more convenient than paper maps. I don’t want to carry the unnecessary paper outside. But if I have no choice, I will choose to use the paper maps that I need.
 - How often do you use maps on your phone?
It depends on where I wanna go, if I go to somewhere I am familiar with, I won’t use the maps. Cause I remembered the way I usually go. vice versa, when I need to go to places that I don’t know about, I will use the maps.
 - Do you have maps at home?
Of course I have, it is a world map hanging up on the wall but just for decoration now. When I was a child, I used that map to learn about geography knowledge and the positions of other countries. It can stand for one part of my childhood.
