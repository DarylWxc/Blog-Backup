***Culture is the essence of a country. With the passage of time, nations become virtuous and kind because they have their own unique cultures. Culture often represents our dreams or life goals. Therefore, people not only care about their living conditions, but also have a curiosity about the history of houses and buildings. They want to experience the spirit of the culture and the emotions of the builders. Many famous buildings have different stories that hold significant meaning for humanity. For example, Egyptians take pride in their pyramids, Americans feel a sense of greatness when they look at the Statue of Liberty, and Christians find peace when they are in a church. Different buildings have varying meanings; they may serve as symbols for certain individuals. It is important for us to respect these buildings. It is not just modern buildings that have value in today's world. Through the study of the history of buildings, we can gain knowledge from different perspectives. We can gather information about the time of construction, the builders, the location, and the local history, among other things. The time of construction often has reasons and purposes behind it. By researching the builders, we can understand the kind of people they were. The location of a building can provide insights into why it was erected. Exploring the local history helps us understand the significance of buildings for the local people. Through this research, we can discover the meaning of speci al buildings and gain a deeper understanding of the culture. And let's not forget one important thing - people like to take photos of buildings as a way to preserve memories. Maybe after many years, they will find encouragement and value in those pictures.

## analyse the question
***Actually the advantages of driverless vehicles will not outweight the disadvantages.In the future,the cars,buses and trucks be the driverless,the people can come out with these traffic tools.It is just one way of commute methods.We can't negelect the risk with development of technology,but it really benefit us more.When the vehicles are spread out for using,people only need to make the decision about destinations.They don't need to worry a lot about traffic congested.In the operation of artifial robot,the traffic rules will be followed better.The safety is much more well than driving on the road.The man may be unconcious sometimes,but the system merely not be.We can imagine that we use the uber app for calling taxi,absolutely it is driveless one.We just need to input the location then we call the car for us,just like the personal buses,that will be amazing for us.We know that technology brought so much convinience for us.It make more choice for us to choose.But there is not only just means the advantages,but also means the challenges.Everyone have the chance to set the new commercial model for earning money.When the innovation of digital world came to us,the majority felt pinic about the changes of environment.They afraid that they can't keep up with this society then will be discarded.Someone is still waiting around the road and shake their hands for taxi.These situations still exist.Maybe they can't accept the progress of devices,but we can guide them to try for it.People always keep doubt about the new things come to them.It is not easy for them to change themselves and adapt to new world.We just want to stay at a peace zoon that make us feel comfortable.But we can't limited in a small area,the new AI age is coming,we can keep a suspect but shouldn't deny it all.You can hardly recollect the memories about the life without your cellphones in the past.Even if you protest it at that time.When you feel out for the society around you,you will keep learning to fit the environemnt by youself.That often be the truth.***

## discuss about one question
***Everyone have different senses about the meaning of their life.You may think this is important to feel happiness all the time.but he think he must achieve something famous that honor himself which is the life goal of him.We all have the rights to choose what type of life we want.The god give the free mind to people,we are exactly not the same kind.Actually the benefit of taking risks not fit everyone at the same time.Just like the lifestyle of areas,they got different culture and habit.Can you imagine that all the things of person are the same?It seems so terrible.For the one which full of spirit about adventure,it is better to take risks with everything.cause they always can't help trying to do something.The achievements of progress are what they done.Such as the scientists or the researchers.They heavily contribute to the human beings.on the other hand,we can't neglect the meaning of the ordinary people.Maybe their dream is just about a peaceful life.That is absolutely right.The society is combinded with various styles of people.Even if they are not famous.The streets need to be cleaned,the food of restaurants must be supproted,or the trees should be transplanted etc.Maybe something like that seems not so important for our lifes.But this is necessary for us.We can't deny the diversity of the world.We all born with gifts.The abilities of discrepancy for everyone could be great much.Maybe that guy get used to sing the song,and he have the genious about music.That may be impossible for others to say that he take risks about his music career.but he can take risks about his personal lives about marriage or relationship.That is depend on what he perfer.***
