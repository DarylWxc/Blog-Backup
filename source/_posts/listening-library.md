 ## listening trick
 - 我们可以先完整地播放一遍答案句，边听边记录句子的主干信息，随后播放第二遍，尽量能够将句子补充完整，如果不能，反复循环播放(建议不超过5遍)直至句子被补充完整。最后再进行校对，找出那一部分出了问题，是没有听到单复数，连读？还是不认识这个单词？最后的最后，一定不要忘记进行错题记录！只有认真分析了自己曾经错在哪里，将来考试时才能避免犯同样的错误。除此之外，始终保持语感。平常多听BBC、TED 此类音频增强语感已经是老生常谈了，学姐还建议大家在考前有意识地多听听力，保持语感，才能在考试中发挥出应有的水平。平时听听力时可以选择1.2甚至是1.5倍速播放联系，这样在实际考试当天，大家才不会觉得语速过快而跟不上哦~(精听)

 - 审题阶段，我们可以在题目上划出关键词，方便做题
 圈出定位词:即数字、时间、地点、名词、形容词、否定词
